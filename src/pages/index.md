## Work Experience

### REWE International AG

**Chief Product Owner eCommerce**
_Jan 2022 - Present_

I manage three cross-functional product teams responsible for the end-to-end development of our online shops (Web, Android, iOS), including ERP integration and data warehouse ETL processes. Im responsible for about 30 internal employees and a varying number of external contractors.

- **Successes**: Launched the online shops for Austria and Czechia while scaling the team. Successfully migrated all infrastructure to the cloud and stabilized the software stack for high-load scenarios. Consistently invested into software quality and accessibility.
- **Team**: Expanded the team capacity by more than 60% within 2 years. Built up two component-teams from scratch. Keeping turnover to almost zero.
- **Processes**: We operate using scaled agile methodologies. We actively work on increasing deployment frequency and reducing lead times.
- **Budget**: I am responsible for the budget planning and controlling for our department.

**Head of Business Consulting**
_Oct 2019 - Jan 2022_

My responsibilities included business consulting and portfolio management for RIAG.digital, a software delivery unit within REWE International IT. The main task was prioritizing and defining the roadmap for our area, in close coordination with all stakeholders. In close collaboration with Agile Coaches, I implemented a comprehensive portfolio planning and reporting system, applying Kanban and Flight Levels methodologies. This process, combined with active stakeholder management, facilitated alignment with strategic business objectives. The setup improved visibility and transparency of portfolio performance, which in turn enabled data-driven decision-making and supported a culture mutual trust.

**Head of Software Quality**
_Jun 2017 - Oct 2019_

I managed a team of quality engineers embedded within the product teams within RIAG.digital, a software delivery unit within REWE International IT.

- **Technologies**: Introduced Jira XRay and SonarQube as standard tools to centralize test management and monitor code quality.
- **Practices**: Defined the QA and automation strategy across a diverse stack (Cypress, Appium, Browserstack).

**Project Manager**
_Jun 2015 - Jun 2017_

As project manager, I was responsible for the development and launch of the Merkur online shop. I took ownership of a project in a complex state, involving three development partners and dispersed internal resources operating without a unified process. My primary objective was to streamline the project. I accomplished this by consolidating the external partners, establishing a central Jira project with a common Scrum process, and implementing monthly management reports. Concurrently, I worked with the teams to introduce a central git repository with defined workflows, an Artifactory instance for package management, and a new caching infrastructure. The shop was successfully delivered and went into production.

### s4w straight4ward GmbH

**Founder**
_Feb 2013 - Apr 2015_

I co-founded s4w straight4ward GmbH, a consultancy focused on software development and services. We successfully secured the City of Vienna as our primary client, for whom we delivered several mobile applications and a data management solution. After a period of significant strategic change at our main client, I exited the company to seek a new professional challenge.

### Pfizer

**From Developer to Team Lead**
_Oct 2006 - Feb 2013_

I started as a C#/ASP.NET developer and transitioned to Technical Project Manager and finally Backend Development Team Lead during a growth phase from 4 to 70 employees.

We rolled out global brand websites and mobile applications, focusing on brand awareness and medical education.
