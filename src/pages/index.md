# Thomas Lichtenecker

## About Me

I am the Chief Product Owner for eCommerce Customer Touchpoints at REWE International AG (IT), leading a unit of approximately 30 people with full responsibility for the product strategy and development of our online shop software stack. My role also includes complete financial oversight for the unit, from budgeting to controlling.

We navigate a complex enterprise environment, which necessitates a scaled agile approach with a strong emphasis on cross-team dependency management. In all development, I advocate for a customer-centric model, guided by agile principles and a firm commitment to high standards in software engineering.

## Work Experience

### [REWE International AG](https://rewe-group.at)

#### Chief Product Owner eCommerce Customer Touchpoints | Jan 2022 - Present

I manage three cross-functional product teams responsible for the end-to-end development and maintenance of our online shops (web, Android, iOS). My teams also handle their integration with the internal ERP system and manage the ETL processes that populate the company data warehouse. We operate using scaled, agile methodologies with a consistent focus on high-quality, sustainable software development.

Key achievements in this role include the launch of the BILLA online shops in Austria and Czechia, a full migration of all infrastructure to the cloud, and the stabilization of the complete software stack. We also implemented significant accessibility improvements and delivered numerous new features.

#### Head of Business Consulting | Oct 2019 - Jan 2022

My responsibilities included business consulting and portfolio management for RIAG.digital, a unit within REWE International IT. In close collaboration with Agile Coaches, I implemented a comprehensive portfolio planning and reporting system, applying Kanban and Flight Levels methodologies. This process, combined with active stakeholder management, facilitated alignment with strategic business objectives. The setup improved visibility and transparency of portfolio performance, which in turn enabled data-driven decision-making and supported a wider culture of continuous improvement.

#### Head of Software Quality | Jun 2017 - Oct 2019

"I managed a team of quality engineers embedded within multiple product teams. My role involved defining the quality assurance and automation strategy across a diverse software stack, which required applying various frameworks (e.g., Cypress, Appium, Cucumber).

To centralise test management and improve technical quality, I introduced XRay for Jira as the primary reporting suite and SonarQube to monitor code quality and test coverage.

#### Project Manager | Jun 2015 - Jun 2017

As project manager for the Merkur online shop, I was responsible for its development and launch. I took ownership of the project in a complex state, which involved three development partners and dispersed internal resources operating without a unified process.

My primary objective was to streamline the project. I accomplished this by consolidating the external partners, establishing a central Jira project with a common Scrum process, and implementing monthly management reports.

Concurrently, I worked with the teams to introduce a central git repository with defined workflows, an Artifactory instance for package management, and a new caching infrastructure. The shop was successfully delivered and went into production.

### s4w straight4ward GmbH

#### Founder | Feb 2013 - Apr 2015

I co-founded s4w straight4ward GmbH, a consultancy focused on software development and services. We successfully secured the City of Vienna as our primary client, for whom we delivered several mobile applications and a data management solution. After a period of significant strategic change at our main client, I exited the company to seek a new professional challenge.

### [Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com)

#### From Developer to Development Team Lead | Oct 2006 - Feb 2013

I joined as a C#/ASP.NET developer and transitioned into leadership roles during a period of company growth from 4 to 70 people, first as a Technical Project Manager and then as Development Team Lead.

As Team Lead, I managed 15 web and mobile developers. My role covered the full scope of team leadership, including people management, project and task management, and setting the technical direction for our applications.
