      My responsibilities included business consulting and portfolio management for RIAG.digital, a software delivery unit within REWE International IT. The main task was prioritizing and defining the roadmap for our area, in close coordination with all stakeholders. In close collaboration with Agile Coaches, I implemented a comprehensive portfolio planning and reporting system, applying Kanban and Flight Levels methodologies.

I accomplished this by consolidating the external partners, establishing a central Jira project with a common Scrum process, and implementing monthly management reports.

The shop was successfully delivered and went into production.
